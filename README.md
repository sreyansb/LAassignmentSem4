# Linear Algebra assignment for Semester.
A repository of the codes that I built/updated with Openmp in C.
I have copied a large part of my code from online sources. They coded it in C and then my friend [Krishna](https://github.com/krishnas2k) and I added more features and OPENMP directives to parallelise the working.

Snapshots of the commands to run the file **gauss.c** and also check its performance is:

1: ![Gauss 1](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/gauss1.png)

2: ![Gauss 2](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/gauss2.png)

The code was taken from [this link](https://github.com/gmendonca/gaussian-elimination-pthreads-openmp/blob/master/openmp_gauss.c)

Snapshots of the commands to run the file **lufactorization.c** and also check its performance is:

1: ![LU factorization 1](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/LU_Factorization1.png)

2: ![LU factorization 2](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/LU_Factorization2.png)

3: ![LU factorization 3](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/LU_Factorization3.png)

4: ![LU factorization 4](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/LU_Factorization4.png)

The code was taken from [this link](https://github.com/puneetar/Parallel-LU-Factorization-with-OpenMP-MPI/blob/master/src/MPI.c)

Snapshot of the commands to run the file **eigen.c** and also check its performance is:

1: ![Eigen 1](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/eigen_values_vectors1.png)

The  basic framework of the code was taken from [this link](http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/download/eigeng.c).

Snapshot of the commands to run the file **normalequation.c** and also check its performance is:

1: ![Normal Equation 1](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/normalequation1.png)

A major part of this code was written by [me](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/normalequation.c).
The code for the inverse of matrices was taken from [this link](https://www.sanfoundry.com/c-program-find-inverse-matrix/).

Snapshot of the commands to run the file **power.c** and also check its performance is:

1: ![Power 1](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/power_method1.png)

The basic framework of the code was taken from [this link](http://ganeshtiwaridotcomdotnp.blogspot.com/2009/12/c-c-code-power-method-numerical-method.html).

Snapshot of the commands to run the file **rank.c** and also check its performance is:

1: ![Rank 1](https://github.com/sreyansb/LAassignmentSem4/blob/master/Snapshots/rank1.png)

The idea was taken from [this book](http://www.grad.hr/nastava/gs/prg/NumericalRecipesinC.pdf).

*Replace agnmtx.c with the name of the file you are running.
